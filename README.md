Hi! My name is Tomás Honse.

I'm from Argentina 🇦🇷

I'm currently studying Electronic Engineering and also I'm a member of the "Roberto Rocca" program at Techint.

I'm interested on embedded system programming, I daily use C and can use a little bit of Python.

I always want to talk about Naruto 🦊 and Harry Potter ⚡🧙

I love reading books 📚❤️
